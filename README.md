#**TensorFlow Object Detection API Installation**
* Now that you have installed TensorFlow, it is time to install the TensorFlow Object Detection API.

### **Downloading the TensorFlow Model Garden**
* Create a new folder under a path of your choice and name it TensorFlow. (e.g. C:\Users\sglvladi\Documents\TensorFlow).

* From your Terminal cd into the TensorFlow directory.

* To download the models you can either use Git to clone the TensorFlow Models repository inside the TensorFlow folder, or you can simply download it as a ZIP and extract its contents inside the TensorFlow folder. To keep things consistent, in the latter case you will have to rename the extracted folder models-master to models.

* You should now have a single folder named models under your TensorFlow folder, which contains another 4 folders as such:



```
# This is formatted as code
PotholeCaseStudy/
└─ models/
   ├─ community/
   ├─ official/
   ├─ orbit/
   ├─ research/
   └── ...
```
* Move 'research' directory to 'src'
